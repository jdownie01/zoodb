ZooDB
=====
ZooDB is an object oriented database based on the JDO 3.0 standard.
It is written by Tilmann Zäschke (Tilmann Zaeschke).
It is licensed under GPLv3 (GNU Public License), see file COPYING.


Current Status
==============
Under development, but already in use by some university projects.


Current Features
================
- Fast (4x faster than db4o using db4o's PolePosition benchmark suite)
- Reasonably scalable, has been used successfully with 60,000,000+ objects in a 30GB+ database
- Crash-recovery/immunity (dual flush, no log-file required)
- Open source (GPL)
- Standard stuff: commit/rollback, query, indexing, lazy-loading, transitive persistence & updates, embedded object support (second class objects) 
- XML export/import (currently binary attributes)


Current Limitations
===================
- Schema evolution is ~80% complete
- No backup (except copying the DB file)
- Single-user/single session only
- Not thread-safe
- No stand-alone server
- JDO only partially supported:
  - only basic queries
  - No XML config or Annotations; configuration only via Java API
  - Manual enhancement of classes required (insert activateRead()/activateWrite() & extend provided super-class).
- Little documentation (some example code), but follows JDO 3.0 spec.
